# ðŸŒ² About Me

I am currently a doctoral student at [Lanzhou University (å…°å·žå¤§å­¦)](https://www.lzu.edu.cn/) under the supervision of [Prof. Jianping Huang (é»„å»ºå¹³æ•™æŽˆ)](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=1OFMwwkAAAAJ). I am scheduled to complete my doctoral studies in June 2024, and I am actively exploring opportunities for a Post Doctoral position.

My research interests lie in investigating the anthropogenic impact on global environments from an interdisciplinary perspective as well as the related health impacts. Specifically, I am interested in the following topics:
- Anthropogenic impacts on O<sub>2</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub> cycle at both global and regional scales
- Influence of meteorological, climatic, and environmental factors on the transmission dynamics of infectious diseases
