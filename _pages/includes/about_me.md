# ðŸŒ² About Me

I am currently a doctoral student at [Lanzhou University (å…°å·žå¤§å­¦)](https://www.lzu.edu.cn/) under the supervision of [Prof. Jianping Huang (é»„å»ºå¹³æ•™æŽˆ)](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=1OFMwwkAAAAJ). I am scheduled to complete my doctoral studies in June 2024, and I am actively exploring opportunities for a Post Doctoral position.

My research interests lie in investigating the anthropogenic impact on global environments from an interdisciplinary perspective as well as the related health impacts. Specifically, I am interested in the following topics:
- Anthropogenic impacts on O<sub>2</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub> cycle at both global and regional scales
- Influence of meteorological, climatic, and environmental factors on the transmission dynamics of infectious diseases

I have published 5 first-authored papers, including 1 **[ESI highly cited paper](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2021.110874)**, as well as 2 paper selected as the **journal front cover**, with <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=_cQXFJMAAAAJ'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url={{ url | url_encode }}&logo=Google%20Scholar&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations"></a>.
