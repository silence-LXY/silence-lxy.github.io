# 🌲 About Me

I am currently a doctoral student at [Lanzhou University (兰州大学)](https://www.lzu.edu.cn/) under the supervision of [Prof. Jianping Huang (黄建平教授)](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=1OFMwwkAAAAJ).

My research interests lie in investigating the anthropogenic impact on global environments from an interdisciplinary perspective. Specifically, I am interested in the following topics:
- Anthropogenic impacts on O<sub>2</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub> cycle at both global and regional scales;
- Influence of meteorological, climatic, and environmental factors on the transmission dynamics of infectious diseases.
