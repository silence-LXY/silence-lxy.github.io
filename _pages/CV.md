## üîé Research Experience

### Anthropogenic Impact on Atmospheric O<sub>2</sub> Budget (2019-Present)
- **Background**:  
  Atmospheric O<sub>2</sub> plays a crucial role in global biogeochemical cycles and is essential for supporting life. However, observations have indicated a declining atmospheric O<sub>2</sub> concentrations since the late 1980s. I used process-driven and data-driven models to explore the atmospheric O<sub>2</sub> budget on both regional and global scales.

- **Objective**:
  - Simulate and predict the global O<sub>2</sub> cycle in past and future climate scenarios.
  - Quantify the human impact on regional atmospheric O<sub>2</sub> budget.

- **Contribution**:
  - Developed a novel and comprehensive inventory of global atmospheric O<sub>2</sub> uptake at 0.1¬∞√ó0.1¬∞ resolution.
  - Employed Earth system models to assess and predict the global atmospheric O<sub>2</sub> budget across various historical periods and future projections.
  - Explored 'urban respiration' based on atmospheric O<sub>2</sub> measurements and a Lagrangian atmospheric transport model (STILT), and quantified contributions of fossil fuel combustion and resident respiration to O<sub>2</sub> variability in the urban atmosphere.
  - Developed an atmospheric O<sub>2</sub> simulator based on explainable ensemble machine learning algorithms, and explored the non-linear dynamics between O<sub>2</sub> and various pollutants.

- **Impact**:  
  The study I led presents one of the first high-precision atmospheric O<sub>2</sub> measurements in China and earned recognition with two front cover features in [Environmental Science and Technology](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.est.2c07583) and [Environmental Science and Technology Letters](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.estlett.3c00505).
  
### Quantifying the Seasonal Impacts on Infectious Disease Transmission (2020-2022)
- **Background**:  
  The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in hugely disruptive impacts across almost all sectors of society. My role involved working in a multidisciplinary team to understand and predict the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic and to inform public health interventions.

- **Objective**:
  - Isolate the seasonal impact in the presence of limited data and difficulties in separating the impacts of social distancing.
  - Build a Global Prediction System for the COVID-19 Pandemic that integrates the impact of environmental factors, public behaviors, government response, etc.

- **Contribution**: 
  - Developed a rolling window method based on a Bayesian inference model and a nonlinear least-squares algorithm to solve the SEIR model parameters.
  - Simulated a counterfactual scenario where COVID-19 is spreading without seasonality to isolate the seasonal impact.
  - Used the EEMD method to decompose the COVID-19 time series to detect potential seasonal signals, and validated results against the simulations by the SEIR model.
  - Led a multidisciplinary team to write up research work for peer-reviewed publications, and integrated my module into the [Global Prediction System for the COVID-19 Pandemic](http://covid-19.lzu.edu.cn/).

- **Impact**:  
  [My first-authored paper](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2021.110874) has been cited by prestigious journals such as [Nature Medicine](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-021-01303-y) and [The Lancet Public Health](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanpub/article/PIIS2468-2667(22)00001-9/fulltext). It has been recognized as a [highly cited paper](https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000639328800153) (Top 1%) since August 2021, and referenced in policy documents by the [U.S. federal government](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2022/03/16/2022-05636/asylum-interview-interpreter-requirement-modification-due-to-covid-19) and the [European Union](https://www.europarl.europa.eu/thinktank/en/document/EPRS_STU(2022)729374).
