# üå≤ About Me

I am currently a doctoral student at [Lanzhou University](https://www.lzu.edu.cn/) under the supervision of [Prof. Jianping Huang](https://hjp.lzu.edu.cn/).

My research interests lie in investigating the anthropogenic impact on global environments from an interdisciplinary perspective as well as the related health impacts. Specifically, I am interested in the following topics:
- Anthropogenic impacts on global O<sub>2</sub> cycle at both global and regional scale
- Influence of meteorological, climatic, and environmental factors on the transmission dynamics of infectious diseases

I have published over 30 peer-reviewed papers <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=_cQXFJMAAAAJ'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url={{ url | url_encode }}&logo=Google%20Scholar&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations"></a>, with my research appearing in top journals such as <em>National Science Review</em>, <em>Science Bulletin</em>, and <em>Environmental Science &amp; Technology</em>. Among these, I have authored 4 first-authored papers, including 1 [highly cited paper](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2021.110874), as well as 1 paper selected as the [front cover](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.est.2c07583).

["Urban Respiration" Revealed by Atmospheric O<sub>2</sub> Measurements in an Industrial Metropolis](images/EST_O2.pdf)\\
**Xiaoyue Liu**, Jianping Huang*, Li Wang, et al., 2023, <em>Environmental Science &amp; Technology</em>

- **Backgrounds**: Urban regions are the largest sinks of atmospheric O<sub>2</sub>, yet long-term O<sub>2</sub> measurements in urban regions are currently lacking.
- **Findings**: In densely populated urban regions, resident respiration could make non-negligible contributions (27.50% to 33.08%) to the observed fluctuations in urban O<sub>2</sub> variability.
- **Impact**: This study presents one of the first high-precision O<sub>2</sub> measurements in China. It is featured as the [**front cover**](https://pubs.acs.org/toc/esthag/57/6) article in <em>ES&T</em> and has garnered attention from various media outlets, including [<em>Xinhua News</em>](https://xhnewsapi.xinhuaxmt.com/share/news_pc?id=808424365805568&showType=3002&utdId=0&version=3.1.3), [<em>China Daily</em>](http://epaper.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202304/12/WS6435f895a310777689888092.html), [<em>Sciencenet</em>](https://news.sciencenet.cn/htmlnews/2023/3/496021.shtm), [<em>Science and Technology Daily</em>](http://www.stdaily.com/index/kejixinwen/202303/29dac5d4564a4725bb84962c6b8e8376.shtml) among others.

[The role of seasonality in the spread of COVID-19 pandemic](images/ER_COVID.pdf)\\
**Xiaoyue Liu**, Jianping Huang*, Changyu Li, et al., 2021, <em>Environmental Research</em>

- **Findings**: COVID-19 seasonality is quantified using epidemiological and statistical models.
  - <font size=2>COVID-19 seasonality exhibits a more pronounced pattern at higher latitudes, where larger seasonal amplitudes of environmental indicators are observed.
  - <font size=2>40‚Äì60% of COVID-19 cases are associated with seasonality. However, seasonality alone is not sufficient to fully curb the transmission of COVID-19.
- **Impact**: As part of the [Global Prediction System of the COVID-19 Pandemic](http://covid-19.lzu.edu.cn/) established by the team led by [Prof. Huang](http://jhuang.lzu.edu.cn/), the paper has received citations from prestigious journals such as [<em>Nature Medicine</em>](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-021-01303-y), [<em>the Lancet Public health</em>](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanpub/article/PIIS2468-2667(22)00001-9/fulltext). It has also been recognized as an [**ESI highly cited paper**](https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000639328800153).
