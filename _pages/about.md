I am a Ph.D. Candidate at <a target="_blank" href="https://www.lzu.edu.cn/">Lanzhou University (å…°å·žå¤§å­¦)</a> under the supervision of <a target="_blank" href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=1OFMwwkAAAAJ">Prof. Jianping Huang (é»„å»ºå¹³æ•™æŽˆ)</a>.
<br>
My primary research focus areas include:
<ul>
<li>Anthropogenic impacts on O<sub>2</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub> cycle at both global and regional scales;</li>
<li>Influence of meteorological, climatic, and environmental factors on public health.</li>
</ul>
As I approach my thesis defense in June 2024, I am actively exploring potential postdoctoral opportunities, not only in these specific areas but also in related fields where my skills and interests can contribute significantly.
