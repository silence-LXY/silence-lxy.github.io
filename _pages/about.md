# ðŸŒ² About Me <span style="float:right"><font size=2>(Last updated on 2024.9.17)</font></span>

I am a research fellow within the [Climate, Environment, and Health Program](https://sph.nus.edu.sg/research/climate-environment-and-health-programme/) at Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, National University of Singapore. My research lies at the intersection of climate change and public health, exploring how climate, weather and environment factors influence health under a changing climate. Using innovative data-driven models and multidisciplinary approaches, I aim to bridge the gap between climate and health sciences, providing evidence-based insights to guide public health interventions.

Before joining NUS, I completed my PhD in climatology at [Lanzhou University](https://en.lzu.edu.cn/), where I was supervised by [Prof. Jianping Huang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=1OFMwwkAAAAJ&hl=en). My multidisciplinary experience there helped me develop a strong interest in understanding the connections between climate and health that facilitate my transition from a focus on climate science to exploring its broader impacts on public health.
