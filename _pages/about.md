# ðŸŒ² About Me

<img src='../images/my-photo-4.jpg' class="floatpic" alt="sym" align='right' width="32.5%">

I am am a Ph.D. Candidate at [Lanzhou University (å…°å·žå¤§å­¦)](https://www.lzu.edu.cn/) under the supervision of [Prof. Jianping Huang (é»„å»ºå¹³æ•™æŽˆ)](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=1OFMwwkAAAAJ).

My primary research focus areas include:
- Anthropogenic impacts on O<sub>2</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub> cycle at both global and regional scales;
- Influence of meteorological, climatic, and environmental factors on public health.

As I approach my thesis defense in June 2024, I am actively exploring potential postdoctoral opportunities, not only in these specific areas but also in related fields where my skills and interests can contribute significantly.
