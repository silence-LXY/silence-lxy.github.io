## üîé Research Experience
### Anthropogenic Impact on O<sub>2</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub> budget (2019-Present)
- **Regional Scale**: Explored urban O<sub>2</sub> budgets, and examined non-linear relationships between O<sub>2</sub> and human activities in urban Lanzhou based on high-precision O<sub>2</sub> measurements and process-based and data-driven modeling techniques

- **Global Scale**: Developed a novel and comprehensive inventory of global atmospheric O<sub>2</sub> uptake, and employed Earth system models to assess and predict the global atmospheric O<sub>2</sub> budget across various historical periods and future projections

### Health Risk Assessment under Climate Change (2020-Present)
- Refined and improved the SEIR epidemic model by integrating seasonal variability, and quantified the influence of meteorological and environmental factors on the transmission dynamics of infectious diseases in close collaboration with epidemiologists

- Played a pivotal role in the interdisciplinary team that developed the Global Prediction System for the COVID-19 pandemic, contributing to the model‚Äôs robustness and predictive accuracy in assessing public health risks under various climate conditions and government response levels
